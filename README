This demo program inserts into a left-leaning red-black tree, and prints a description of the tree. By default the tree is printed in Graphviz dot language, and you can use Graphviz tools to visualize the tree; if you comment out "#define GRAPHVIZ" in llrb.h, then it prints a level-order traversal.

----------
To compile
----------
g++ -o llrb-test llrb-test.cpp


------------------------------------
To generate nice trees with Graphviz
------------------------------------
dot test.out | gvpr -c -ftree.g | neato -n -Tpng -o tree.png


--------
Commands
--------
insert i		Insert a key i (integer) into the tree
print  			Print the tree
exit			Terminate the program (you must include this command as the last one of your input file, if you use one)
